What we plan to do in the future:
 
 - add a "summary chart" feature where total time, packet time (asterisks included), and time of day the packets were sent are shown to the user, with several details of the run
  
 - keep track of the servers the packets were sent to and trace what countries those are, showing the places in the world the packet is travelling (DO THIS BEFORE IT'S DUE)
 
Nice to do:
 - check that arguments provided are ok (error checking)
 - Just add drop downs instead of writing things down
 - add threading to program so it doesnt just hang when performing pings
 - write our own traceroute library if time allows
