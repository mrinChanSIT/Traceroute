How to run the program:
Method 1:
 - Run the executable (.exe) if you are on a windows machine.
 - You can download the executable from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nR3EHq8Gx4Jry9-k5Tau_Am7EztM8vQx/view?usp=share_link

Method 2:
 - Make sure you have python installed, and run the terminal in this folder. Then type:
 - python traceroute_tool.py 
 Note: if it fails it because you are missing certain libraries. Make sure all the modules in the requirements.txt file are installed first with pip.
 
What does each part of the program mean?
For this, I recommend seeing the presentation folder which contains slides that explain in detail what the program can accomplish.

Feel free to watch a demo of the program here:
